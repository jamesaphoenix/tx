title: "PRD-013: Dashboard UX Improvements"
description: "Pagination, filtering, search, and keyboard navigation for the tx dashboard"
---

**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P1 (Should Have)
**Owner**: TBD
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-30

---

## Problem Statement

The tx dashboard (`apps/dashboard/`) provides basic visibility into tasks and agent runs, but lacks the UX polish needed for effective monitoring:

1. **No pagination** - Lists load all items at once, causing slow renders with many tasks/runs
2. **No filtering/search** - Users can't find specific tasks or runs without scrolling
3. **Limited task detail** - Clicking a task doesn't show full info (description, deps, children)
4. **No keyboard navigation** - Power users must use the mouse for everything
5. **Basic loading states** - Simple spinners instead of skeleton placeholders

These limitations make the dashboard frustrating to use when monitoring long-running RALPH loops or large task backlogs.

---

## Target Users

| User Type | Primary Actions | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Human Engineers | Monitor RALPH progress, review runs, inspect tasks | High (during dev) |
| AI Agents | N/A (dashboard is human-facing) | None |

---

## Goals

1. **Scalability**: Support 1000+ tasks and 500+ runs without UI lag
2. **Discoverability**: Find any task or run within 3 interactions
3. **Keyboard-first**: Navigate entirely with keyboard (vim-style)
4. **Visual clarity**: Clear loading, empty, and error states

---

## Non-Goals

- Mobile responsiveness (desktop-first tool)
- Task creation/editing (use CLI for mutations)
- Real-time WebSocket updates (polling is sufficient)
- Authentication (single-user local tool)

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Initial load time | <1s | With 100 tasks visible |
| Scroll-to-load latency | <200ms | Next page fetch |
| Find specific task | <5s | Using search |
| Keyboard navigation adoption | >50% | Of list interactions |

## User Stories

### US-013-001: Infinite Scroll Tasks
```
As a human engineer,
I want tasks to load more as I scroll down,
So that I can browse large backlogs without waiting for all tasks to load.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Initial load shows 20 tasks
- Scrolling near bottom triggers next page fetch
- Loading skeleton appears during fetch
- Total count displayed in header

### US-013-002: Filter Tasks by Status
```
As a human engineer,
I want to filter tasks by status (ready, active, blocked, done),
So that I can focus on tasks in a specific state.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Status toggles appear above task list
- Multiple statuses can be selected
- URL updates with filter state (shareable)
- Count per status shown on toggle

### US-013-003: Search Tasks
```
As a human engineer,
I want to search tasks by title or description,
So that I can quickly find a specific task I'm looking for.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Search input with placeholder text
- Debounced search (300ms delay)
- Matches highlighted in results
- "No results" empty state

### US-013-004: View Task Details
```
As a human engineer,
I want to click a task to see full details in a side panel,
So that I can see description, dependencies, and children without leaving the list.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Click task opens slide-in panel
- Panel shows: title, status, score, description, blockedBy, blocks, children
- Related tasks are clickable (navigate within panel)
- Escape closes panel

### US-013-005: Keyboard Navigation
```
As a power user,
I want to navigate task/run lists with arrow keys,
So that I can browse efficiently without touching the mouse.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Up/Down (or j/k) moves focus
- Enter selects/opens focused item
- Escape closes any open panel
- Focus indicator clearly visible

### US-013-006: Filter Runs
```
As a human engineer,
I want to filter runs by agent type or status,
So that I can find runs from a specific agent or failed runs.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Agent dropdown filter
- Status filter (running, completed, failed)
- Filters combinable

### US-013-007: Visual Polish
```
As a human engineer,
I want clear loading and empty states,
So that I understand what's happening and what actions to take.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Shimmer skeleton during loads (not spinners)
- Empty state with icon and helpful message
- Smooth transitions when opening/closing panels
- Subtle animations on list item appearance

- [PRD-001](/docs/prd/prd-001-core-task-management): Core task model
- [PRD-007](/docs/prd/prd-007-multi-interface-integration): Multi-interface integration

## Open Questions

1. Should filters persist in localStorage or only URL?
2. Do we need a "Tasks I'm blocked by" view for agents to prioritize?
3. Should keyboard shortcuts be configurable?
