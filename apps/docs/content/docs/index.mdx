# tx

**TanStack for AI agents.** Primitives, not frameworks.

Headless infrastructure for memory, tasks, and orchestration.

## The Problem

Your agents lose context between sessions. Tasks collide when multiple agents work in parallel. Learnings vanish into conversation history. You're rebuilding the same infrastructure every project.

## The Solution

Composable primitives that handle the hard parts. You keep control of the orchestration.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Orchestration (your code, your rules)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  tx primitives                                          │
│                                                         │
│   tx ready     tx done      tx context    tx learn      │
│   tx claim     tx block     tx handoff    tx sync       │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why Primitives?

The orchestration flow is where you create value. It encodes your domain knowledge:
- How your codebase works
- What your agents are good at
- Where humans need to intervene
- How you handle failures

**If we dictate the flow, we're not a tool. We're a competitor.** We don't know your domain, your constraints, or whether you need 3 agents or 30.

TanStack won by saying: "Here's headless table logic. Style it yourself."

tx says: "Here's headless agent infrastructure. Orchestrate it yourself."

## Core Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [`tx ready`](/docs/primitives/ready) | Get next workable task (unblocked, highest priority) |
| [`tx done`](/docs/primitives/done) | Complete task, potentially unblocking others |
| [`tx block`](/docs/primitives/block) | Declare dependencies between tasks |
| [`tx claim`](/docs/primitives/claim) | Mark task as being worked by an agent |
| [`tx handoff`](/docs/primitives/handoff) | Transfer task with context to another agent |
| [`tx checkpoint`](/docs/primitives/checkpoint) | Save progress without completing |
| [`tx context`](/docs/primitives/context) | Get relevant learnings for prompt injection |
| [`tx learning:*`](/docs/primitives/learning) | Record and search knowledge |
| [`tx sync`](/docs/primitives/sync) | Persist to git-friendly JSONL |

## Get Started

Ready to dive in? Follow the [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started) to install tx and run your first task loop.

## Design Principles

- **No opinions on orchestration.** Serial, parallel, swarm, human-in-loop. Your call.
- **Powerful defaults.** `tx ready` just works. So does dependency resolution.
- **Escape hatches everywhere.** Raw SQL access, JSONL export, custom scoring.
- **Framework agnostic.** CLI, MCP, REST API, TypeScript SDK. Use what fits.
- **Local-first.** SQLite + git. No server required. Works offline.

## Interfaces

| Interface | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **CLI** | Scripts, terminal workflows, agent loops |
| **MCP Server** | Claude Code integration (16 tools) |
| **REST API** | Custom dashboards, external integrations |
| **TypeScript SDK** | Programmatic access from your agents |
| **Dashboard** | Visual monitoring and management |
