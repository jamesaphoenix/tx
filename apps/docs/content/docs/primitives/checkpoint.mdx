title: tx checkpoint
description: Save progress without completing

> **Status**: Planned - This primitive is not yet implemented.

## Purpose

`tx checkpoint` will save progress on a task without marking it complete. This is useful for long-running tasks where you want to persist state in case of interruption.

## Planned Usage

```bash
tx checkpoint <id> [options]
```

## Planned Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--note <text>` | Progress note describing current state |
| `--file <path>` | Attach a file with checkpoint data |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

## Planned Examples

```bash
# Checkpoint with note
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Completed API endpoints, starting frontend"

# Checkpoint with file
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --file ./progress.md

# Multiple checkpoints
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Step 1: Database schema done"
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Step 2: API endpoints done"
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Step 3: Frontend components done"
```

## Use Case: Long-Running Tasks

For tasks that span multiple agent sessions:

```bash
# Session 1: Start implementation
tx claim tx-abc123 --agent worker-1
# ... work on task ...
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Completed database layer, 40% done"

# Session 2: Continue from checkpoint
tx show tx-abc123  # See checkpoints
# ... continue work ...
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Completed API layer, 70% done"

# Session 3: Finish
tx show tx-abc123  # Review all progress
# ... finish work ...
tx done tx-abc123
```

## Use Case: Crash Recovery

If an agent crashes mid-task:

```bash
# Before crash
tx checkpoint tx-abc123 --note "Written files: src/auth.ts, src/login.ts"

# After recovery
tx show tx-abc123
# Output shows: "Last checkpoint: Written files: src/auth.ts, src/login.ts"
# Agent knows where to resume
```

## Planned Checkpoint Format

```json
{
  "id": "tx-abc123",
  "checkpoints": [
    {
      "at": "2025-01-28T10:00:00Z",
      "agent": "worker-1",
      "note": "Completed database layer, 40% done"
    },
    {
      "at": "2025-01-28T12:00:00Z",
      "agent": "worker-1",
      "note": "Completed API layer, 70% done",
      "files": ["progress.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Viewing Checkpoints

```bash
tx show tx-abc123

Task: tx-abc123
  Title: Implement authentication
  Status: active
  Claimed by: worker-1

  Checkpoints:
    1. [2025-01-28 10:00] Completed database layer, 40% done
    2. [2025-01-28 12:00] Completed API layer, 70% done
```
