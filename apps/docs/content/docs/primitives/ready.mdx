title: tx ready
description: List tasks that are ready to work on
---

## Purpose

`tx ready` returns tasks that are ready to be worked on. A task is ready when:

1. Its status is workable (`backlog`, `ready`, `planning`, `active`, `blocked`, or `review`)
2. All tasks blocking it have status `done`

Tasks are sorted by score (highest first), making it easy for agents to pick the highest-priority unblocked task.

## Usage

```bash
tx ready [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--limit, -n <n>` | Maximum tasks to show (default: 10) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON for scripting |
| `--help` | Show help |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Top 10 ready tasks
tx ready

# Top 5 ready tasks
tx ready -n 5
```

### JSON Output for Scripting

```bash
# Get ready tasks as JSON
tx ready --json

# Get the ID of the highest-priority ready task
tx ready --json --limit 1 | jq -r '.[0].id'
```

## Output

### Text Output

```
Ready tasks (sorted by score):

 1. tx-abc123  [800]  Implement authentication
 2. tx-def456  [600]  Add login page
 3. tx-ghi789  [500]  Write unit tests
```

### JSON Output

```json
[
  {
    "id": "tx-abc123",
    "title": "Implement authentication",
    "status": "ready",
    "score": 800,
    "blockedBy": [],
    "blocks": ["tx-def456"],
    "children": [],
    "isReady": true
  }
]
```

## TaskWithDeps Response

Every response includes full dependency information per [Rule 1](/docs/prd/prd-001-core-task-management):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `blockedBy` | `TaskId[]` | Task IDs that block this task |
| `blocks` | `TaskId[]` | Task IDs this task blocks |
| `children` | `TaskId[]` | Direct child task IDs |
| `isReady` | `boolean` | Whether this task can be worked on |

## Agent Loop Pattern

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple agent loop using tx ready

while true; do
  # Get highest priority ready task
  TASK=$(tx ready --json --limit 1 | jq -r '.[0].id // empty')

  # Exit if no ready tasks
  [ -z "$TASK" ] && break

  # Work on the task
  claude "Your task is $TASK. Run 'tx show $TASK' to see details."

  # Mark complete
  tx done "$TASK"
done

echo "All tasks complete!"
```
