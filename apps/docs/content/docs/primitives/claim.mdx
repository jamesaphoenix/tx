title: tx claim
description: Mark a task as being worked by an agent
---

> **Status**: Planned - This primitive is not yet implemented.

## Purpose

`tx claim` will mark a task as being actively worked on by a specific agent. This prevents multiple agents from picking the same task and duplicating work.

## Planned Usage

```bash
tx claim <id> [options]
```

## Planned Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--agent <name>` | Agent identifier claiming the task |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Auto-release after timeout (default: 3600) |
| `--next` | Claim the next ready task automatically |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

## Planned Examples

```bash
# Claim a specific task
tx claim tx-abc123 --agent worker-1

# Claim the next ready task
tx claim --next --agent worker-1

# Claim with 30-minute timeout
tx claim tx-abc123 --agent worker-1 --timeout 1800
```

## Use Case: Parallel Agent Execution

Without claims, parallel agents might pick the same task:

```bash
# Problem: Both agents pick the same task
Agent1: tx ready --limit 1  → tx-abc123
Agent2: tx ready --limit 1  → tx-abc123  # Same task!
```

With claims:

```bash
# Solution: Claims prevent collision
Agent1: tx claim --next --agent worker-1  → tx-abc123
Agent2: tx claim --next --agent worker-2  → tx-def456  # Different task
```

## Planned Behavior

1. **Claiming** sets `claimed_by` and `claimed_at` on the task
2. **Ready queries** exclude claimed tasks (unless `--include-claimed`)
3. **Timeouts** auto-release abandoned claims
4. **Completing** a task automatically releases its claim
