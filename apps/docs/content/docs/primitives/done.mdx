title: tx done
description: Mark a task as complete
---

## Purpose

`tx done` marks a task as complete by setting its status to `done`. This is the primary way to signal that work on a task is finished.

When a task is completed, any tasks that were waiting on it may become unblocked. The command reports which tasks are newly unblocked.

## Usage

```bash
tx done <id> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `<id>` | Yes | Task ID (e.g., `tx-a1b2c3d4`) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON (includes task and newly unblocked task IDs) |
| `--help` | Show help |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Mark a task as complete
tx done tx-abc123
```

### JSON Output

```bash
# Complete a task and get JSON response
tx done tx-abc123 --json
```

## Output

### Text Output

```
Task tx-abc123 marked as done.

Newly unblocked tasks:
  tx-def456  Add login page
  tx-ghi789  Write integration tests
```

### JSON Output

```json
{
  "task": {
    "id": "tx-abc123",
    "title": "Implement authentication",
    "status": "done",
    "score": 800,
    "blockedBy": [],
    "blocks": ["tx-def456", "tx-ghi789"],
    "children": [],
    "isReady": false
  },
  "unblocked": ["tx-def456", "tx-ghi789"]
}
```

## Cascade Unblocking

When you complete a task, tx automatically checks which tasks were waiting on it:

```
Before tx done tx-auth:

  tx-auth [done]
      ↓ blocks
  tx-login [blocked]
      ↓ blocks
  tx-dashboard [blocked]

After tx done tx-auth:

  tx-auth [done]
      ↓ blocks
  tx-login [ready]     ← Newly unblocked!
      ↓ blocks
  tx-dashboard [blocked]  ← Still blocked by tx-login
```

## Agent Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete a task and immediately start the next one

# Finish current task
tx done tx-abc123

# Get next ready task
NEXT=$(tx ready --json --limit 1 | jq -r '.[0].id // empty')

if [ -n "$NEXT" ]; then
  echo "Next task: $NEXT"
  tx show "$NEXT"
fi
```

## Idempotency

Calling `tx done` on an already-completed task is a no-op. The task remains in `done` status and no error is raised.

```bash
tx done tx-abc123  # First call: marks as done
tx done tx-abc123  # Second call: no-op, already done
```
