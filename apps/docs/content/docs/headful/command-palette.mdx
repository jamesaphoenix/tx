title: Command Palette
description: Cmd+K everywhere across dashboard surfaces
---

The command palette is now global across dashboard views.

- `Cmd+K` on macOS
- `Ctrl+K` on Windows/Linux
- `Esc` to close

## Tasks Context

From the Tasks view, the palette exposes actions, navigation targets, and filter shortcuts in one place.

## Task Detail Context

Within Task Detail, the palette surfaces task-scoped operations (for example create sub-task, copy task reference, cycle status) plus shared navigation.

## Why This Matters

- Fewer pointer-only interactions for power users.
- Faster context switches between Tasks, Docs, Runs, and Cycles.
- A single interaction model for both global and task-level actions.
