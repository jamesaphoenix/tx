title: Docs, Runs, and Cycles
description: Dashboard panes beyond task management
---

The dashboard now keeps Docs, Runs, and Cycles consistent with the same navigation model as Tasks.

## Docs View

The Docs surface uses a sidebar + detail pane model so you can browse structured docs and inspect content without losing context.

## Runs View

Runs gives a split layout for agent/run selection on the left and conversation details on the right, with clear empty states when no runs are active.

## Cycles View

Cycles provides a queue/detail split and communicates scan status immediately when no cycle data exists yet.

## Navigation Consistency

- Same top-level tabs across all surfaces.
- Same command palette entry point (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`).
- Same empty-state style for quicker orientation.
