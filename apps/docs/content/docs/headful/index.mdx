title: Headful Experience
description: Dashboard UX for tasks, docs, runs, and cycles
---

The dashboard gives you a visual, keyboard-first layer on top of tx primitives. This section documents the current headful UX and the workflows it unlocks.

This is step 3 of the guided journey: after [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) and [Primitives](/docs/primitives), you use the same model through a visual interface. Watchdog comes after this as an advanced, optional step.

## What Changed Recently

- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` command palette is available everywhere in the dashboard.
- Task and sub-task workflows support faster bulk selection and action flows.
- Assignment + label filters are available from the Tasks toolbar.
- Settings includes label create/edit/delete flows.
- Task detail layout is tighter, with a stronger split between content and properties.
- Docs, Runs, and Cycles views have clearer empty states and panel behavior.

## Explore the Headful Docs

- [Tasks and sub-tasks](/docs/headful/tasks-and-subtasks)
- [Filters and settings](/docs/headful/filters-and-settings)
- [Command palette (Cmd+K)](/docs/headful/command-palette)
- [Docs, runs, and cycles views](/docs/headful/docs-runs-cycles)

## Headful + Headless

The UI is intentionally a layer over the same primitives:

- Work queue and status transitions map to `tx ready`, `tx done`, and status updates.
- Task relationships and bulk operations map to dependency and hierarchy primitives.
- Keyboard actions mirror command-line intent for fast operator workflows.

## Suggested Path

1. [Tasks and sub-tasks](/docs/headful/tasks-and-subtasks)
2. [Filters and settings](/docs/headful/filters-and-settings)
3. [Command palette](/docs/headful/command-palette)
4. [Docs, runs, and cycles](/docs/headful/docs-runs-cycles)

## Next Step

When this workflow feels solid, continue to the **[Watchdog Runbook](/docs/watchdog-runbook)** for detached supervision, rollback, and recovery playbooks.
