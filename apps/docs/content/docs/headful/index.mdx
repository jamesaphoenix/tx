title: Headful Experience
description: Dashboard UX for tasks, docs, runs, and cycles
---

The dashboard gives you a visual, keyboard-first layer on top of tx primitives. This section documents the current headful UX and the workflows it unlocks.

## What Changed Recently

- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` command palette is available everywhere in the dashboard.
- Task and sub-task workflows now support faster bulk selection and action flows.
- Task detail layout is tighter, with a stronger split between content and properties.
- Docs, Runs, and Cycles views have clearer empty states and panel behavior.

## Headful + Headless

The UI is intentionally a layer over the same primitives:

- Work queue and status transitions map to `tx ready`, `tx done`, and status updates.
- Task relationships and bulk operations map to dependency and hierarchy primitives.
- Keyboard actions mirror command-line intent for fast operator workflows.
