This page covers the updated task list and task detail experience.

## Tasks Overview

The Tasks view combines queue metrics, status filtering, and search so you can move between triage and execution without leaving the page.

## Task Detail + Properties

Task detail gives you:

- parent task context and score
- editable task body
- child task list
- right-side properties/actions panel

## Child Task Bulk Selection

Sub-task operations now support fast multi-select flows for batch work.

## Practical Flow

1. Open a parent task from the Tasks list.
2. Select child tasks that should be handled together.
3. Run the relevant batch action.
4. Use command palette actions when you want keyboard-only execution.
