The Tasks surface now supports richer client-side filtering, and Settings now includes label CRUD so you can tune workflows without leaving the dashboard.

## Task Filters

The filter control sits next to backlog/in-progress/done, with assignment + labels in a compact popover.

Highlights:

- Assignment filter supports all/human/agent/unassigned.
- Labels filter supports multi-select.
- Active filter count is shown on the filter button.

## Settings CRUD

Settings now includes:

- default task assignment type
- label create/edit/delete controls
