# tx

> Primitives, not frameworks. Headless infrastructure for memory, tasks, and orchestration.

tx provides composable primitives for agent infrastructure — task management, memory, coordination, and observability. You own the orchestration; tx owns the plumbing.

## Docs

- [Overview](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs): What tx is and why primitives beat frameworks
- [Getting Started](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started): Install tx and run your first agent loop

## Primitives

- [tx ready](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/ready): Get next workable task (unblocked, highest priority)
- [tx done](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/done): Complete task, potentially unblocking others
- [tx block](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/block): Declare dependencies between tasks
- [tx claim](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/claim): Claim task with lease to prevent parallel collisions
- [tx context](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/context): Get relevant learnings for prompt injection
- [tx learning](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/learning): Record and search knowledge
- [tx sync](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/sync): Persist to git-friendly JSONL
- [tx try / tx attempts](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/attempts): Record and track implementation attempts
- [tx doc](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/docs): Docs-as-primitives with YAML structured documentation
- [tx invariant](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/invariants): Machine-checkable system rules with enforcement tracking
- [tx trace](https://tx-docs.vercel.app/docs/primitives/traces): Execution tracing and run observability
